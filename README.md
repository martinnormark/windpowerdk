Windpower in Denmark
===========

Denmark is one of the [leading countries in windpower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country) - especially when compared to the size of the country. There's currently more than 5000 windmills 
in our small, flat and windy country - and on the countryside a 360 degree look at the horizon 
easily reveals 10-20, sometimes even 30 or 40 windmills.
